    "## The Brazilian hydrothermal power operation planning problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brazilian hydrothermal power system is a large scale network of facilities that can be used to produce and distribute energy by circulating H$_2$O fluids (water). The power plants in the Brazilian network can be categorized into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A set of hydro plants $H$, which has no production cost, but for each hydro plant $h \\in H$ there is an upper limit $\\bar q_h$, which is the maximum allowed amount of turbined flow that can be used for power generation. These hydro plants can also be categorized further into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Hydro plants with reservoirs $H_R$, and for each $h \\in H_R$ there is an upper and lower limit on the level of water allowed in the reservoirs, denoted by $\\underline{v}_{h, t}$ and $\\bar v_{h, t}$, respectively.\n",
    "    * Hydro plants without reservoirs (run-of-river) $H_I$, and thus no water storage is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Moreover, for each hydro plant $h$, a unit of released water will generate $r_h$ units of power, also known as efficiency rate. The set of immediate upper and lower stream plants for hydro plant $h$ in the network is given by $U(h)$ and $L(h)$, respectively.\n",
    "* A set of thermal plants $F$, where for each thermal plant $f \\in F$, the minimum and maximum amount of  power generation allowed is $\\underline{g}_{f, t}$ and $\\bar g_{f, t}$, respectively, $\\forall \\; t =1, \\dots, T$.  Additionally, each plant $f \\in F$ is associated with an operating cost of $c_{f,t}$ for each unit of thermal power generated. We denote the cost vector of generating thermal power at time $t$ by $\\vec{c}_{g, t}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the hydrothermal power operation planning problem (HPOP) problem, the goal of the DM is to find an operation strategy $\\pi$, in order to meet production targets (demands) $d_{t}$ for each decision stage $t, \\; \\forall \\; t=1, \\dots, T$, while minimizing the overall production cost. To do this, at each decision stage $t$ and given the state of the system $s_t$ (i.e., the water level at each hydro plant $h \\in H_R$), the DM has to decide on how much water to turbine by each hydro plant $h \\in H$ and how much thermal power to generate by each plant $f \\in F$. In the event where the levels of energy production using hydro/thermal plants does not meet the levels of demand, the DM must pay a penalty of $c_{p,t}$ for each unit of unsatisfied demand. Such penalty can also be thought of as a cost of buying energy from the outside market, which typically has a higher cost compared to the cost of generating energy using internal resources (thermal plants), i.e., $c_{p,t}  > \\max_{f\\in F}\\{c_{f,t}\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The HPOP problem can be modeled as an MSP problem because of the uncertainty in the problem data, such as future inflows (amount of rainfall) $\\tilde b_t := \\vec{\\tilde b}_{t} (\\xi_t)$, demand $d_t := \\vec{\\tilde d}_{t}(\\xi_t)$, fuel costs $\\tilde c_t := \\vec{\\tilde c}_{t}(\\xi_t)$ and equipment availability. We will use the notation $b_{t}, d_{t}, c_{t}$ whenever the parameter is deterministic (e.g.,  stage $t=1$) and $\\tilde b_{t}, \\tilde d_{t}, \\tilde c_{t}$ whenever it is random. To introduce a mathematical programming formulation for the decision problem which the DM has to solve at every decision stage $t$, for $t=1, \\dots, T$, consider the following decision variables:\n",

    "* $\\vec{y}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H}_{+}$: where $y_{h, t}$ is the amount of water turbined by each hydro plant $h \\in H$.\n",
